Your code is well-organized into methods and follows a logical flow, which is good for readability and maintainability. Error handling is present in some parts of the code, but it can be improved. 
Ensure comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations and provide informative error messages to users. Consider adding comments to explain complex logic, 
particularly where the code might not be self-explanatory. Good documentation can assist other developers (or your future self) in understanding the codebase.
